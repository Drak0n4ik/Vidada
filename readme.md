Vidada
=======

Vidada is a video clip manager which supports custom Tags and supports nearly every video format. You can have thousands of movies indexed, and all can be in the thumbnail view. Vidada has an custom written Thumbnail viewer which has an intelligent just-in-time rendering to support unlimited number of items.

Also, Vidada does not dictate you any folder structure. Instead, the file contents are indexed (file hashes), which means that you can even move your video clips around in your media library, or you can rename them. Hell, you can keep your files organized the way you have and also change the directory structure anytime.

Vidada also supports a feature called DirectPlay - if you select a video clip in the Thumb viewer, it will start playing. Move your mouse over the movie, and it will automatically seek to the relative position. Preview a video was never easier.

### MAC OS X Hack for Retina Support

Since Vidada switched to JavaFX, HDPI rendering is supported natively. Hell yeah!
